### Trying my hand at graphics on the windows terminal

Just a simple gradient test, video test, and image test

To start it run "run.bat", you can run "run2.bat" if you want, but it'll display wrong

"run.bat" along with the shortcut sets up the terminal in the correct way while "run2.bat" actually handles the display

It takes advantage of conhosts ability(that seems to have been lost in the new windows terminal) to set the font size in the shortcut which I then hex edited to make smaller than it usually allows, after that it was pretty easy to get a decent display into the windows terminal
